Introduction
------------
This is a very quick and dirty way of setting up a PAGI application via FastAGI.
You might find the code useful even to launching your own non-PAGI apps.

Configuring
-----------
Copy config.ini.example to config.ini.

Edit config.ini

The [php] section can be filled with options to be set by ini_set automagically.
The [server] section customizes things like address to listen for connections.
The [application] section contains some very specific options related to PAGI:
  * log4php: Absolute path to log4php.properties file to be used by your PAGI app.
  * bootstrap: Absolute path to be required prior to executing your PAGI app (typically
    will set an include path or require some other files).
  * class: The name of your PAGIApplication class.

Running
-------
Just do a
$ php fastagi.php /path/to/my/config.ini
